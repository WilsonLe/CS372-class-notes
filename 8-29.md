## Definition

OS is a software that converts hardware into a useful interface for applications.

Hardware <=> OS <=> Apps

## Why OS?

- Understand what's going on underneath
- Problem solving, data structures, algorithms
- Understadning complex systems

## What will we study about OS?

- How the OS does what it does
- Differences of OS
- Differences between app/OS
  - I.e process (kernel process has access to part of memory, all of everything), very different from the usual processes.

## 3 pieces:

- Virtualization : sharing resources (memory, CPU, disks, etc.)
- Concurrency: independent processes managing interactions
- Persistence: access data permanently, files, file system
